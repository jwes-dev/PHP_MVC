# PHP_MVC
MVC framework as designed by Microsoft in ASP.NET with basic functionality. 
If you are an ASP.NET developer and need to build a web app in php, try this. We are ASP.NET developers oursself and had a tough time developing in PHP, So we thought WHY NOT!
Hence, we made a basic MVC in PHP inspired by ASP.NET MVC. You can contribute your functions by sending the codes in a mail to jwes.device@gmail.com


Also I used a PHPMailer library; I don't remember who developed it hence I couldn't add their reference. will add it once I find out.
